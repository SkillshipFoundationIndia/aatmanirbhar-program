 DAY 6 - ARRAY ROTATING AND OTHER ARRAY PROBLEMS
   tasks:
   https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-array/
   given an array example ar= { 1,2,3,4,5} of size n
   and q set of queries and x for each q. Queries can be of two types 
   1 - left rotate array by x times
   2 - right rotate array by x times
   return the array after perfroming q set of queries
   
   Sample case 1:
   ar = { 4,7,9,0,4}
   q=3
   1 3
   2 8
   1 9
   2 2
   1 2
   Ans : {4,4,7,9,0}
